# Ajax Comments

Convert comment forms to use Ajax so you can add/edit/reply to comments and
see them appear (or disappear) without needing to refresh the entire page.

## Installation

 - Install this module using the [official Backdrop CMS instructions](https://backdropcms.org/guide/modules).

## Configuration and Usage

You can select which content type(s) to add this functionality to, and choose
whether to add or disable:

 - a notification message when comments are posted
 - scrolling to the comment form
 - automatic closing of the comment reply form
